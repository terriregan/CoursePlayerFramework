## CoursePlayerFramework

### About
The CoursePlayerFramework was used in the [Intelligence / Signals Analysis Net](http://terriregan.herokuapp.com/work/sanet) courses. The framework needed to:  (1) load external animation, media and data files, (2) be fully 508 compliant and (3) deploy to the web, to a LMS and to a CD.
