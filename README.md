## CoursePlayerFramework

### About
The CoursePlayerFramework is a reusable framework that was used in the [Intelligence / Signals Analysis Net](http://terriregan.herokuapp.com/work/sanet) suite of 6 courses. Each course contained between 4 to 9 modules.  While each module contained between 15 to 45 screens. The framework needed to:  
- load each module and configure itself based on the module's data manifest, 
- load and manage external animations
- load activity data files
- load both audio and video files
- export glossary to pdf and excel formats
- manage applicatin state
- provide robust 508 accessbility
- intergate with the LMS via a javascript wrapper
- deploy to the web, to a LMS and to a CD
